    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> This easy gourmet sandwich is so good, you would serve it to the president if you had him over for dinner. As
        far as grilled cheese goes, this is it! Serve with a nice gourmet Italian salad.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul tyle="line-height:0.8;margin:0">
        <li>Â¼ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices cooked bacon</li>
        <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices sourdough bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Preperation</h4>
    <ol>

        <li>In a small bowl, mash together the butter and Parmesan cheese until evenly blended. Make sandwiches by
            placing two slices of bacon and one slice of Cheddar cheese on half of the bread slices. Top with the
            remaining slices of bread.</li>

        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Spread some of the butter mixture on the top of each sandwich. Place
            sandwiches butter side down in the skillet. Spread the remaining butter mixture on the other sides. Cook
            until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes per side. To serve, cut in half diagonally.</li>
