In this first project I would lay to build a simple recipe website from scratch using what ive learned in HTML the past 2 days with as little refrence as possible.

Day 1: Created index and first page while following refrence, the 2 after I managed to put together with minimal refrence. Learned about
 < br > and it gave the pages a much nicer feel

 Day 2: Cleaned up layout of text to make it more user friendly and implemented return buttons so the user never has to leave the page to back track.
